#### Kotlin Web Template Example.


This was created for nothing more expect for an example for my old professor who wanted my assistance with a lesson.

Very basic example of how HTML templating is constructed... might MAYBE update to this over time as the course is laid out.

Free to use 

<h2>YES I KNOW ITS BAD XD</h2>

For right now all I have supported for replacing string

In HTML [% VAL-(variable_name)  %]<br>
In Main.kt Add variable_name, key to webCFG.globalHashMap
